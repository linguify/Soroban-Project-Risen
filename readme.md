# Project Structure

contract.rs: Your smart contract code.
Cargo.toml: Project dependencies.
soroban_sdk.toml: Soroban configuration.
Game Client: A frontend or game engine using a Stellar SDK to interact with the smart contract.

2. Game Client Interaction

You'll need a game client (using a Stellar SDK) that:

Reports Scores: Calls report_score on the contract after gameplay events.
Claim Rewards: Provides an interface for users to call claim_rewards.
Handles Transfers: Manages XLM/token transfers for claiming rewards.
Important Considerations:

Tokenomics: Design the economics of your reward token carefully.
Reward Calculation: Implement more complex logic for rewards based on milestones, leaderboards, etc. Think about how to tie these to your specific game mechanics.
Game Integration: Tightly integrate the smart contract calls into your game's logic.
Anti-Fraud: You may need measures to prevent players from manipulating scores.
Security: As always, audit your smart contract thoroughly before deploying with real assets.

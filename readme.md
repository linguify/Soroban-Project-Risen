## 1. Introduction
This guide provides instructions for integrating a game client with a Stellar-based smart contract. The integration involves reporting scores, claiming rewards, and managing transfers using the Stellar SDK.

## 2. Game Client Interaction
The game client should perform the following interactions with the smart contract:

### Reports Scores
- Implement functionality to call `report_score` on the contract after gameplay events.
- Ensure accurate reporting to prevent fraudulent score manipulation.

### Claim Rewards
- Provide users with an interface to call `claim_rewards` to redeem their rewards.
- Handle XLM/token transfers securely within the game client.

### Handles Transfers
- Manage transfers of XLM or custom tokens for claiming rewards.
- Implement security measures to prevent unauthorized transfers.

## 3. Important Considerations
When integrating the game client with the smart contract, consider the following factors:

### Tokenomics
- Design the economics of the reward token carefully, considering factors such as supply, distribution, and utility within the game ecosystem.

### Reward Calculation
- Implement logic for calculating rewards based on various factors such as milestones, leaderboards, and game mechanics.
- Ensure fairness and transparency in reward distribution.

### Game Integration
- Tightly integrate smart contract calls into the game's logic to provide a seamless user experience.
- Consider how smart contract interactions enhance the gameplay experience for users.

### Anti-Fraud Measures
- Implement measures to prevent players from manipulating scores or exploiting loopholes in the reward system.
- Use techniques such as encryption, validation checks, and consensus mechanisms to mitigate fraud risks.

### Security
- Thoroughly audit the smart contract code before deploying it with real assets.
- Follow best practices for smart contract security to mitigate potential vulnerabilities and risks.

## 4. Conclusion
Integrating a game client with a Stellar-based smart contract offers opportunities for creating engaging gameplay experiences and rewarding players for their achievements. By following the guidelines outlined in this guide, developers can ensure a secure and seamless integration that enhances the overall gaming ecosystem.
